以上为示例脚本内容





# Scene: A quiet park at sunset. The sky is painted with hues of orange and pink.

# Alice: It's so peaceful here. I could stay forever.

# Brian: Yeah, it's a nice break from the chaos of the city.

# Alice looks up at the sky, her eyes reflecting the colors of the sunset.

# Alice: Do you remember the first time we came here?

# Brian: How could I forget? You were chasing that squirrel and tripped over your own feet.

# Alice laughs, the sound light and carefree.

# Alice: Hey, that squirrel was fast! But you caught me before I hit the ground.

# Brian smiles, his gaze softening as he watches her.

# Brian: I'll always be there to catch you, Alice.

# A gentle breeze rustles the leaves around them, carrying the scent of blooming flowers.

# Alice: Brian, there's something I've been meaning to tell you.

# Brian: What is it?

# Alice takes a deep breath, her heart pounding in her chest.

# Alice: I... I think I'm falling for you.

# Brian's eyes widen in surprise, but then a warm smile spreads across his face.

# Brian: Funny, I was just about to say the same thing.

# They both laugh, the tension melting away as they realize their feelings are mutual.

# The sun dips below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the park. As the first stars begin to twinkle in the night sky, Alice and Brian share a tender embrace, knowing that this moment marks the beginning of something beautiful.
